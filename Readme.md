# **Template your Node Application**

This is an Awesome way of using EJS to Template Your Node Application.

When quickly creating Node applications, a fast way to template your application is sometimes necessary.

**What I learned from This**

Setting up a project and configuring it with server.js
Creating EJS partials (eg head.ejs, header.ejs and footer.ejs)

Adding these partials to views

Passing Data to Views and Partials
Rendering a Single Variable in EJS

Looping Over Data in EJS
And Passing Data to a Partial in EJS


EJS lets you build applications when you do not require additional complexity. By using partials and having the ability to easily pass variables to your views, you can build some great applications quickly.
